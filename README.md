This repository contains the PCF controls developed by Delegate. We will put focus in this are, so stay tuned by following the repo.

# Year Picker
This control is bound to a Date-only field. The purpose is to make it easier to only pick a year from a date field. The input field is a number field, so a num-pad appears on mobile.
The control is styled to match the input fields on a Model-driven app.
